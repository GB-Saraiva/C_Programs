# C_Programs
Here you can find and explore my most relevant programs and projects made all by **C** language.

## atividades
In the **"atividades"** folder, you'll find lists containing numerous exercises to practice, starting with the basics and increasing in dificulty with each one.

## teste-c
Just a folder with some random programs that I have created or intend to create, unrelated to the exercises in **"atividades"**.
